**41 tools. Zero API keys. Give any local LLM real Google search, live feeds, vision, OCR, and full video understanding.**

An MCP server that turns your local LLM into a fully connected assistant. Real Google results, live news and social feeds, reverse image search, offline OCR, YouTube transcription and clip extraction — all running locally through headless Chromium and open-source ML models. No API keys, no usage limits, no cloud dependency.

Works with **LM Studio**, **Claude Desktop**, **OpenClaw**, **Ollama**, and any MCP-compatible client.

## What's New in v0.3.3 — `/health` Endpoint + Monitoring

The MCP server now exposes a small HTTP health server on a separate port
(default **`11499`**) so you can monitor the service with Prometheus,
k8s probes, or any HTTP-aware monitoring tool. The endpoint runs
alongside the MCP server in the same Python process — independent of
the MCP transport (works whether you're behind `mcp-proxy`, running
streamable HTTP, or stdio).

**Endpoints:**

| URL | Returns | Use for |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `GET /` | Index of available endpoints | Discovery |
| `GET /health` | Full JSON snapshot | Dashboards, alerting |
| `GET /health/live` | `{"status":"alive","uptime_sec":...}` | k8s liveness probe |
| `GET /health/ready` | 200 if critical deps present, else 503 | k8s readiness probe |
| `GET /version` | Version + git commit hash | "What's running where?" |

**What the response includes:**

- **Service status**: `ok` / `degraded` / `down` (HTTP 200 / 200 / 503)
- **Version** + **git commit** (full hash, short, branch, dirty flag, `git describe`)
- **Python & platform** info (version, executable, OS, machine, node, argv)
- **Process metrics** (PID, PPID, RSS memory, VMS, CPU%, thread count, nice)
- **MCP introspection** (tool count, prompt count, resource count, **full list of tool names**)
- **Config snapshot** (env-driven settings: `ENABLE_MANUAL_INTERVENTION`, `SKIP_COOKIE_VALIDATION`, etc.)
- **Dependency status** for every Python package: `playwright` (with chromium install path!), `opencv`, `onnxruntime`, `faster_whisper`, `yt_dlp`, `rapidocr`, `lingua`, `psutil`, `starlette`, `uvicorn`
- **File presence & sizes** for `google_cookies.txt`, `youtube_cookies.txt`, auto-saved cookies, MobileNetV2 model, feeds DB, browser data dir
- **Disk usage** for the cache directory (free / total / used %)
- **Manual intervention state** (enabled, display available, currently active, last result)
- **Startup info** (cookie validation outcome — skipped/passed/errors/warnings)

**Configuration (env vars):**

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ENABLE_HEALTH_SERVER` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable the health server |
| `HEALTH_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `HEALTH_PORT` | `11499` | Bind port (set to `0` for OS-assigned) |
| `HEALTH_AUTH_TOKEN` | _(empty)_ | Optional bearer token for auth |

**Example call:**

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:11499/health/live
{"status":"alive","uptime_sec":1234.5,"pid":4126492}

$ curl http://localhost:11499/health
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime_sec": 1234.5,
  "loaded_at": "2026-08-02T20:25:45.188+00:00",
  "version": "0.3.3",
  "git": {
    "commit": "15763fc9f77c762613ddfea7a4c759b7758ef416",
    "short": "15763fc9",
    "branch": "dev",
    "dirty": false,
    "describe": "v0.3.3-3-g15763fc"
  },
  "python": { ... },
  "platform": { ... },
  "process": { "pid": 4126492, "memory_rss_mb": 153.4, "threads": 7, ... },
  "mcp": { "name": "google-search", "tools": 41, "tool_names": [...] },
  "config": { "ENABLE_MANUAL_INTERVENTION": true, ... },
  "dependencies": { "playwright": { "ok": true, "chromium_installed": true, ... }, ... },
  "files": { "google_cookies": { "exists": true, "size_bytes": 4096 }, ... },
  "disk": { "free_bytes": 12345678901, "free_human": "11.5 GB", "used_percent": 75.3 },
  "manual_intervention": { "enabled": true, "display_available": true, ... },
  "startup": { "cookie_validation_passed": true, ... }
}
```

**Auth (optional):**

```bash
# Set HEALTH_AUTH_TOKEN in the environment
export HEALTH_AUTH_TOKEN="my-secret-token"

# Then call with the bearer token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer my-secret-token" http://localhost:11499/health

# Or as a query parameter (for simple monitoring setups)
curl "http://localhost:11499/health?token=my-secret-token"
```

**Ad-hoc /health snapshot (no server):**

```bash
python -m google_search_mcp.health_server --once | jq
```

This is great for k8s `livenessProbe` / `readinessProbe`, Prometheus
blackbox exporter, Datadog HTTP checks, Grafana synthetic monitoring, or
just a quick `curl` when debugging.

## What's New in v0.3.2 — Smart Bot-Detection Handling (Headful Fallback)

Google is now blocking headless Chromium more aggressively: reCAPTCHAs, sign-in walls, 2-step verification, and "unusual traffic" rate-limits that no neural net can solve. v0.3.2 adds a **headful browser fallback** so you stay in control.

**What it does:**
- When all automatic anti-bot measures fail (stealth patches + auto CAPTCHA solve + retries), the server pops a **visible Chromium window** on your machine
- The window stays open until you solve the block manually (CAPTCHA / login / 2FA / consent) or the configurable timeout fires
- Fresh cookies are saved automatically and the original request is retried
- If you can't / don't want to resolve it, the system gracefully falls back to DuckDuckGo

**New MCP tools:**
| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `open_manual_browser` | Open a headful browser window right now for the user to handle a block |
| `manual_intervention_status` | Check whether a headful window is open and view the last intervention result |

**Auto-triggered by every Google tool:** when a Google tool gets blocked and all automatic measures fail, the system now opens a headful window before falling back. The LLM can also call `open_manual_browser` explicitly when it detects a block.

**Tunable via env:**
| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ENABLE_MANUAL_INTERVENTION` | `1` | Set to `0` to always fall back to DuckDuckGo without opening a window |
| `MANUAL_INTERVENTION_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `300` | How long to wait for you to solve the block (0 = wait forever) |
| `MANUAL_INTERVENTION_POLL_SEC` | `3.0` | How often to check if the page is resolved |

**On a server with no display:** the headful window is auto-detected as unavailable (`DISPLAY`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` unset) and the system falls back to DuckDuckGo silently.

**Concurrency safe:** a global lock prevents two headful windows from opening at once; the second call is rejected with a clear message.

---

## What's New in v0.3.1 — Anti-Bot Detection & Neural Net CAPTCHA Solver

Google started catching headless Chromium browsers and serving CAPTCHAs instead of search results ([#2](https://github.com/VincentKaufmann/noapi-google-search-mcp/issues/2)). Fixed it properly and then added a neural net CAPTCHA solver just for the hell of it.

**Stealth patches:**
- JavaScript injection before every page load patches `navigator.webdriver`, fake browser plugins, `chrome.runtime`, and removes Playwright fingerprints
- Fixed User-Agent mismatch (was `aarch64`, now matches the actual Chromium binary)
- Cookie persistence between sessions so Google sees a returning browser, not a fresh bot
- Human-like random delays between page interactions
- Clear error messages when rate-limited instead of cryptic timeouts

**Neural net CAPTCHA solver (MobileNetV2 + OpenCV):**
- When Google serves a reCAPTCHA image challenge ("Select all images with traffic lights"), the server now attempts to solve it automatically
- Uses MobileNetV2 (ImageNet classifier, ~13MB ONNX model, auto-downloads on first encounter)
- OpenCV splits the CAPTCHA grid into cells, each cell is classified by the neural net and matched against the prompt
- Covers 22 common CAPTCHA categories: traffic lights, buses, bicycles, motorcycles, cars, bridges, boats, trains, trucks, fire hydrants, parking meters, tractors, and more
- Human-like mouse movement for clicking cells and the verify button
- Falls back gracefully if the challenge type isn't supported

Will it solve every CAPTCHA? No. But it'll get through some of them, and honestly we mostly built it because we could.

## What's New in v0.3.0 — 16 New Tools

## YouTube RAG — Subscribe, Transcribe, Search, Clip

A full local retrieval-augmented pipeline for YouTube. Subscribe to any channel, and when you check feeds the server automatically downloads the audio, transcribes it with Whisper, and stores the full transcript in SQLite with FTS5 full-text search. Every word from every video becomes searchable — ask your LLM a question and it pulls the answer from the right video.

Found something interesting? Ask the LLM to extract that segment as a clip. It reads the transcript, finds the exact timestamps, and cuts the video for you. This is the beginning of **AI/LLM-powered video editing** — your LLM understands the content and cuts clips based on what's being said, not just timestamps.

**How it works:**
1. `subscribe` to a YouTube channel — by handle (`@3Blue1Brown`), URL, or channel ID
2. `check_feeds` — new videos are fetched and **auto-transcribed** locally with faster-whisper. Transcripts are written into the database for instant search. Up to 5 videos per check, cached so nothing gets re-downloaded.
3. `search_feeds` — full-text search across all transcripts. Supports AND, OR, NOT, and quoted phrases. Your LLM finds the exact video and passage that answers your question.
4. `extract_video_clip` — tell the LLM what you're interested in and it cuts the clip from the video. The LLM uses the transcript to find the right segment and extracts it automatically.

```
"Subscribe to @AndrejKarpathy on YouTube"
"Check my feeds"
"Search my feeds for backpropagation explained"
"What did Karpathy say about tokenization?"
"Extract the part where he explains gradient descent"
"Cut a clip of the hardware comparison section"
```

No embeddings, no vector database, no API — just Whisper + SQLite FTS5 running on your machine.

> **Roadmap:** The clip extraction is the first step toward full AI-driven video editing. Future releases will add music/audio overlay, video remixing, multi-clip compilation, vertical reformat for TikTok/Reels/Shorts, and automated highlight reels — all driven by your LLM understanding the content.

## Tool Details & Parameters

### Health Endpoint

The health endpoint is **not an MCP tool** — it's a plain HTTP endpoint
on a separate port (default `11499`). It runs alongside the MCP server
and is independent of the MCP transport. Use it for monitoring, k8s
probes, and operational diagnostics.

#### `GET /` — Index of endpoints

Returns a small JSON listing all available endpoints and their purpose.
Useful for discovery.

```json
{
  "service": "noapi-google-search-mcp",
  "version": "0.3.3",
  "endpoints": {
    "GET /":            "this index",
    "GET /health":      "full health snapshot (JSON)",
    "GET /health/live": "liveness probe (200 if process is alive)",
    "GET /health/ready": "readiness probe (200 if critical deps present)",
    "GET /version":     "just version + git commit info"
  }
}
```

#### `GET /health/live` — Liveness probe

Minimal probe. Always 200 if the process is alive. Use for k8s
`livenessProbe`.

```json
{"status": "alive", "uptime_sec": 1234.5, "pid": 4126492}
```

#### `GET /health/ready` — Readiness probe

Returns 200 if all critical dependencies (starlette, uvicorn,
playwright, opencv) are present. Returns 503 if any are missing. Use
for k8s `readinessProbe`.

```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "dependencies": {
    "starlette":  {"ok": true, "version": "0.40.0"},
    "uvicorn":    {"ok": true, "version": "0.30.1"},
    "playwright": {"ok": true, "version": "1.45.0", "chromium_installed": true},
    "opencv":     {"ok": true, "version": "4.10.0"}
  }
}
```

#### `GET /version` — Version + git

```json
{
  "version": "0.3.3",
  "git": {
    "commit": "15763fc9f77c762613ddfea7a4c759b7758ef416",
    "short": "15763fc9",
    "branch": "dev",
    "dirty": false,
    "describe": "v0.3.3-3-g15763fc"
  },
  "python": {
    "version": "3.11.15 ...",
    "implementation": "CPython",
    "executable": "/home/sameer/anaconda3/envs/mcp-google/bin/python"
  }
}
```

#### `GET /health` — Full snapshot

The big one. Returns a comprehensive JSON snapshot of everything the
operator might want to know about the service in a single call. See
the v0.3.3 release notes above for the full schema.

**Response status code:**
- `200` if `status: ok` or `status: degraded`
- `503` if `status: down` (a critical dependency is missing)

**k8s probe example:**

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/live
    port: 11499
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 30

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/ready
    port: 11499
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
```

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ENABLE_HEALTH_SERVER` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable the health server |
| `HEALTH_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `HEALTH_PORT` | `11499` | Bind port (set to `0` for OS-assigned) |
| `HEALTH_AUTH_TOKEN` | _(empty)_ | Optional bearer token for auth |

**Ad-hoc snapshot (no server started):**

```bash
python -m google_search_mcp.health_server --once | jq
```

### Bot-Detection & Diagnostics Tools

#### `open_manual_browser` — Solve a Google Block Manually

Opens a visible (headful) browser window so you can manually resolve a
bot-detection block — CAPTCHA challenge, Google sign-in, 2-step
verification, persistent consent dialog, or anything else that
automated anti-bot measures couldn't handle.

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `url` | URL to open in the visible browser (default Google home) | `"https://www.google.com"`, `"https://www.google.com/sorry/index"` |
| `reason` | Why intervention is needed (just for logging) | `"captcha"`, `"login"`, `"rate_limit"`, `"verification"`, `"unknown"` |
| `timeout_sec` | Override the wait timeout; 0 = server default (300s) | `600` for slow 2FA, `0` for default |

**What it does:**
- Closes the current headless context (frees the browser profile lock)
- Opens a real, visible Chromium window
- Waits for you to interact with the page (solve CAPTCHA, log in, etc.)
- Polls every `MANUAL_INTERVENTION_POLL_SEC` for resolution
- Saves fresh cookies to disk when done
- Returns so you can retry your original request with the new session

**Auto-trigger:** Every Google tool (`google_search`, `google_news`,
`google_images`, `visit_page`, `transcribe_video`, etc.) automatically
calls this under the hood when its automatic anti-bot measures fail.
You can also call it explicitly from the LLM.

**Example user flow:**
> *"Google is showing me a CAPTCHA. Please open a manual browser
> so I can solve it."*
>
> → LLM calls `open_manual_browser(url="...", reason="captcha")`
> → Visible Chromium window appears on your machine
> → You solve the CAPTCHA in the window
> → Tool returns: "✅ Manual intervention successful. 23 cookies saved. Please retry your previous request."

**On a server without DISPLAY:** the call returns a clear message
explaining no display is available, and the system falls back to
DuckDuckGo.

#### `manual_intervention_status` — Check Intervention State

Returns the current state of the manual-intervention system: whether a
window is open, last outcome, timeout / poll settings, and display
availability. Useful for diagnostics without triggering anything.

#### `check_cookies` — Inspect Loaded Cookies

Verify which cookie files are present, the Google domains they cover,
and whether auto-saved session cookies exist. No parameters.

## Sample Prompts

### Health & Monitoring
| What you type | Tool / endpoint called |
|--------------|------------------------|
| *"Is the service healthy?"* | `GET /health/live` |
| *"Are all critical dependencies ready?"* | `GET /health/ready` |
| *"Give me the full health snapshot"* | `GET /health` |
| *"What version of the server is running?"* | `GET /version` |
| *"What's the current git commit?"* | `GET /version` |
| *"How much memory is the server using?"* | `GET /health` (look at `process.memory_rss_mb`) |
| *"Is Playwright's chromium installed?"* | `GET /health` (look at `dependencies.playwright.chromium_installed`) |
| *"How many MCP tools are registered?"* | `GET /health` (look at `mcp.tools` and `mcp.tool_names`) |
| *"Show me the cookie validation result from startup"* | `GET /health` (look at `startup.cookie_validation_passed`) |
| *"When was the service started?"* | `GET /health` (look at `loaded_at` and `uptime_sec`) |

> **Tip:** The health endpoint is independent of the MCP transport. You can curl it from any monitoring tool, k8s liveness/readiness probe, or shell script — no MCP client needed.

### Bot-Detection & Manual Intervention
| What you type | Tool called |
|--------------|-------------|
| *"Google is showing me a CAPTCHA. Open a manual browser so I can solve it."* | `open_manual_browser` |
| *"I'm getting a sign-in page. Open a manual browser so I can log in."* | `open_manual_browser` |
| *"I need to verify with 2FA. Open a headful browser with a 10-minute timeout."* | `open_manual_browser` (with `timeout_sec=600`) |

## Installation

### Quick Install (pipx - recommended)

```bash
pipx install noapi-google-search-mcp
playwright install chromium
```

### Install in a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.local/share/noapi-google-search-mcp
~/.local/share/noapi-google-search-mcp/bin/pip install noapi-google-search-mcp
~/.local/share/noapi-google-search-mcp/bin/playwright install chromium
```

## Configuration

### LM Studio

Add to `~/.lmstudio/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-search": {
      "command": "noapi-google-search-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If installed in a venv, use the full path: `~/.local/share/noapi-google-search-mcp/bin/noapi-google-search-mcp`

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-search": {
      "command": "noapi-google-search-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### OpenClaw

Add to your agent configuration:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  google-search:
    command: "noapi-google-search-mcp"
    env:
      PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1"
```

This gives your OpenClaw agent access to all 41 tools — real Google search, live feeds, vision, OCR, video intelligence, the headful bot-detection fallback, and the built-in health endpoint — with zero API keys.

### As a CLI

```bash
noapi-google-search-mcp
```

Or:

```bash
python -m google_search_mcp
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VincentKaufmann/noapi-google-search-mcp.git
cd google-search-mcp
pip install -e .
